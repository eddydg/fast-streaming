# fast-streaming
Very simple Python script for personal usage :
 - Downloads a video file with aria2c with multiple connections at the same time to bypass some possible speed limit,
 - Starts to download from the begining to start streaming right away,
 - Opens it with VLC.

## TODO List
 - [ ] GUI to enter video URL
 - [ ] Get Subtitles from Subliminal
 - [ ] Browse via SFTP and select video with a UI
